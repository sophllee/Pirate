    <p>This project began with my interest in 3D modeling and animation. I have aspired to learn applications such as Blender, Z-Brush, Maya, etc. but their steep learning curve has intimidated me in the past to sit down and begin. I knew that I wanted to take this final project as an opportunity to finally try and create something in Blender. I have always loved the idea of being transported to a fictitious world, whether that be through books, movies or video games. As I am sure it is for many people, these immersive experiences serve as a form of escapism for me. Originally, I was inspired by websites such as Zoom Quilt and Gridcosm. They have a surrealist, nonsensical artistic style that I enjoy and which I thought I was going to emulate. But as I continued to ideate I ended up taking a different direction, while still subtly gaining inspiration from the linear “journey” both websites take you on. In the brief animated scene I created, I wanted it to possess a video game-like experience that suggests a story. As I continue to experiment with Blender, I plan to continue to add to and iterate the scene. It's a little cheesy but nonetheless I hope you enjoy!</p>
    
    <p> <b>My Process</b>
    <li><b>Photoshop</b> I started by compositing an open static scene using Images from Envato Elements.</li>
    <li><b>Blender</b> I created a high-poly model of the ocean. I used high-poly models of a ship - credits to Walther D. from SketchFab - and a bullet - credits to Stephen from Blender Made Easy. I used particle systems for the rain and bullet trails. I applied materials, texture, color, etc. I used key frames and empty elements for camera movement, water animation, and the flying bullets. In total, the scene is composed of 650 frames. It took over 10 hours to render! I now have an excuse to upgrade my pc :3. Using an image sequence, I rendered the final MKV file.</li>
    <li><b>Code </b> I housed my code in Visual Studio Codes, which I lated pushed to a repository in Github - linke below. I utilized Git LFS to remotely store my large asset files.</li>
    <li><b>Deploying</b> I used Vercel to deploy my repository to the Web, mainly because it supports LFS files.</li>
